Faceless is where you can talk freely, to your friends and the whole world.

You can be open, no matter what you talk about. Nobody will see who you are — it's only about your message.

Enjoy openness and kindness. Get truthful responses and honest opinions. Let your ideas spread around the world.

You don't have a profile to worry about. There's no need to brag. It's just your words that count.

Talk about things that might be embarrassing, and don't be afraid to ask a question. Share things without any downsides!

You will be connected to your friends automatically. Read their messages and write comments — you will never know exactly who they are.

Share stories, ask questions, discuss life or confess things. Just be yourself.

Be honest and genuine. Be smart and positive.


<b>Do I have to sign up for Faceless?</b>
No. You don't need an account, neither an email address nor a password. No Facebook, no Google, no Twitter.

<b>Who can see that I am the author of a message?</b>
Nobody. People will only see that you are a "Friend" or a "Friend of a friend". Otherwise, we may show them your country, but never something specific.

<b>Are comments anonymous as well?</b>
Yes. The only thing that will be shown is whether a comment has been written by the same person who also wrote the original message.

<b>Can I see which of my friends are on Faceless already?</b>
No. This is to protect their privacy. From time to time, we may show you the number of friends, without any names, of course.

<b>Can I ignore or block a particular person?</b>
Yes. If you don't like what a person posts, you can add them to your block list. This cannot be undone later, however!
